# APM Studio

APM Studio is the editor in which you set up the logic and processing that make your Asset Performance Management application. 

Your application may:

- Monitor actuator dysfunctions, such as drive leakage or torque off-spec; or
- Continuously verify the power-consumption of your motors; or
- Co-relate certain symptoms in the time domain of your turbine, indicating excessive wear or other imminent failures.

The applications and solutions you create in APM Studio are not just limited to actuators, motors and turbines.  Any application that requires the continuous evaluation of data and event/alarm streams from your assets can be set-up, tested and deployed using APM Studio. 

APM Studio provides a rich environment allowing you to define your Smart Objects, Automated Root Cause Analysis, Diagnostic Rules and much more.

Within APM Studio, you validate the behaviour of your application and deploy these to embedded systems, running Linux, edge-computers running Ubuntu , Microsoft Windows environments and cloud based infrastructure.

The application or solutions that you create in APM Studio react on your data streams and provide you or your customers insights into how good your assets are performing, and provides continuous diagnosis and prognosis of what could happen. 

If you are new to APM Studio, take a quick look at [First Steps in APM Studio](2. First Steps in APM Studio.md), it explains the basic concepts of the editor.
