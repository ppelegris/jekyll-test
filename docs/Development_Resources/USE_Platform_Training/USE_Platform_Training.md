# USE Platform Training

Training materials for learning about programming on top of the USE Platform and extending it to add custom functionality.

-   [Client Framework Overview](Client_Framework_Overview) — Overview of the platform's Client Framework, which underpins the Thick Client and provides foundation classes for further extension.
-   [Thick Client Overview](Thick_Client_Overview) — Overview of the design, features and nomenclature of the Thick Client framework in the USE Platform
-   [Thin Client Overview](Thin_Client_Overview) — Overview of the implementation of the basic Thin Client functionality.
-   [Building Custom Data Definitions and Client Components](Building_Custom_Data_Definitions_and_Client_Components) — A worked example of adding a new data definition with soft object based persistence, and implementing and registering the client view/model for them. Finally the extensions are packaged into an addin.
-   [Visual Modelling Component Overview](Visual_Modelling_Component_Overview) — An overview of the API to the visual modelling component, which is the basis for all diagrams, rules and schematics in the USE platform.
-   [Visual Modelling Component API Practical Example](Visual_Modelling_Component_API_Practical_Example) — Worked example of adding a new Palette Item to a custom Partition Workspace (Schematic).
