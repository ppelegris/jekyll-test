# Software Configuration Management

In software engineering, software configuration management (SCM)\[1\] is the task of tracking and controlling changes in the software, part of the larger cross-discipline field of configuration management. SCM practices include revision control and the establishment of baselines. If something goes wrong, SCM can determine what was changed and who changed it. If a configuration is working well, SCM can determine how to replicate it across many hosts.

### Revision Control

The **Version Control System (VCS)** that we use for Revision Control is the Distributed VCS (DVCS) **[Git](http://git-scm.com/)**.
